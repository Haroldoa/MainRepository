Hi,\n
These are some samples of my coursework for my Introduction to Computer Science class.

The class was mainly in C++ during Fall 2016 at Biola University.

We used Visual Studio Express 2013 for all our programming assignments, including our midterm assignment.

I have listed some of my weekly programming asssignments in one directory and my midterm assignment in another directory.
