# University Sample Code and Executables
Hi,

These are some samples of my coursework for my Introduction to Computer Science class. This was a first semester introduction to C++ programming. It was procedural based, and I am currently in my second semester course of C++, covering object oriented programming.

We used Visual Studio Express 2013 for all our programming assignments, including our midterm assignment. I have included my source code and a sample executable of a midterm text-based game.

I have listed some of my weekly programming asssignments in one directory and my midterm assignment in another directory.

All the weekly assignments have a corresponding instruction sheet in that directory. These were given by the professor.
