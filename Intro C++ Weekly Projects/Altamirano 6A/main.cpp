Specification: This program can help you get the general idea of how software such
as Microsoft WORD is implemented. Program should provide services for the
user to enter test scores from the **keyboard** and store the scores in an array, to **write
(save)** the scores currently stored in the array into a given file, to **read** a collection of
test scores that are already stored in a given file into an array, to **display the scores**
currently stored in the array and to calculate and **display the related statistics** of the
scores. */
